        <link>http://www.defcon.org/</link>
        <description>DEFCON is the world's largest annual hacker convention, held every year in Las Vegas, Nevada. The first DEFCON took place in June 1993. DEF CON is renowned for the "arcane arts" of drinking, socializing, debugging, and crowd control. DEFCON is what you make of it, so get involved and help the community grow.
This Feed will keep you up to date with some announcements surrounding pre and post con events, references to DEFCON in the news, and other errata. For the most up to date information visit or subscribe to the rss feeds on the forums (http://forum.defcon.org/) See http://www.defcon.org/ for more details, discussion forums, past speeches, and planning for the next year.</description>

            <title>Things are Heating Up!</title>
            <link>https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-21/dc-21-news.html#dc21heatingup</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow is the first official day of summer and, if you really think about it, DEF CON is the main reason summer exists. There are probably some other things going on, like shark attacks and whatnot. There are probably people who prioritize car trips and county fairs over hacker conventions. But you're HERE, so you are probably not one of those people. You are one of US, and you want to know what kind of action we have bubbling for you this year. </p>

<p>Well, the short answer is 'plenty'. Here are some of the current highlights:</p>

<p><strong>The Most Significant Bit</strong></p>

<p>Do you wish there was a contest that would develop your cyber-macho the way TV contests develop back-stabbing and bug-eating? We got you, OK? We got you.</p>

<p>The Most Significant Bit is a new contest that aims to take 16 noobs with a compubox and a dream from "zero to hero" by filling their spare cycles at DEF CON with various challenges
<br />to their hacking and making skills. They will fight to avoid elimination! They will fight to avoid humiliation! They will fight because apparently the winner gets a REAL CROWN*!</p>

<p>To enter, just submit a short (1-2 minute) video to YouTube explaining why this contest needs you. Include the search term dc8bits. (Test number one - following instructions.) 16 players will be chosen to compete, and in the end one contestant's victorious buttocks will feel the incomparable comfort of the 'Throne of Leetness'. If this sounds like something you need in your life, you can find out more at <a href="http://www.dc8bits.org">dc8bits.org</a>.</p>

<p><i>*Street value of the 'Crown of Shiny Bits' is unknown at this time.</i></p>

<p><strong>Hacker Jeopardy Sign-up</strong></p>

<p>Do you and your pals know everything? Can you remember all the everything you know even under extreme alcohol conditions? Do you yearn to be immortalized in DEF CON lore? </p>

<p>Quite possibly the fastest route to glory for people like you is Hacker Jeopardy, the mighty and eternal drunken orgy of geek knowledge. To enter, it is advisable to check out the forum thread and get the lowdown. Host G. Mark Hardy has posted the steps you must take to begin your journey, <a href="https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=13370">and they are fairly specific</a>. The first line is in ALL CAPS, PEOPLE. That's how you know it's business time. If you have a team with the goods, it's time to <a href="https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=13370">get enterin'</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Recruiting agents for the DEF CON DarkNet</strong></p>

<p>Another new game in town this year is the DEF CON DarkNet Project, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game">Alternate Reality Game</a> set in the world of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003QP4NPE/">Daemon</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003QP4NPE/">Freedom</a> by Daniel Suarez.  If the idea of a real-life, real-time MMO appeals to you, you should really check out <a href="https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=13423">the forum thread about the game</a>. It looks very cool.</p>

<p>The team behind the game is also looking for some help if you've got  some skills and some time. They need some web design, some design of the hammer and nails variety and people to design additional quests. <a href="https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=13423">Check out the forum thread</a> and lend a hand if you can.</p>

<p>  Now that the summer is upon us, you'll want to keep an eye on this space. There will be much, much more to come.</p>]]></description>

            <title>Live Transcription at DEF CON 21!</title>
            <link>https://defcon.org/html/defcon-21/dc-21-index.html#dc21captions</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Dark Tangent has signed a contract with a company to transcribe all the speaking tracks as well as the closing ceremony in english.</p>

<p>What does this mean? It means for the third time in DEF CON history we will officially be supporting the hearing impaired. This time around it will be with real time transcription appearing on screen, much like what you would see if you had captioning turned on your TV. </p>

<p>We will get cleaned up files after the con for each speech, allowing us to post the presentation text, as well as caption the video files. See <a href="https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=13183&page=7&p=128440&viewfull=1#post128440">DT's original post</a> to see how you may be able to help with this!</p>

<p>So with that said, we would hate to go through all the work and expense and only have two security ninjas who are hearing impaired attend. Let's promote this far and wide, and over the next couple years try and include as many as possible. The last time we did translation two years in a row we had two or three people the first, and none the second. Let's see if we can do better this time!</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Call For Def Con Capture The Flag Organizers Is Now Complete!</title>
            <link>https://www.defcon.org/index.html#dc21ctfannounce</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-flag.jpg" alt="dc-flag"/></p>

<p>On behalf of all the hundreds of staff, volunteers, and community that make DEF CON happen I would like to thank all of the teams, groups, and companies that submitted their vision of how they would run Capture the Flag at DEF CON 21 and beyond.</p>

<p>It was very hard to for us at DEF CON World Domination HQ to decide on which vision, and ultimately which team, would have the responsibility of seeing the great CTF tradition into the future. With a record number of five well thought out submissions there were many things that went into our final decision from size of team, resources needed, and the look and feel of the contest. Ultimately the following factors weighed heavily:</p>

<p>- Past experience running or participating in high pressure and large scale CTFs
<br />- Past experience of organizers in being respected by the community and having skillz
<br />- A clearly articulated vision for how CTF would evolve under their direction
<br />- A focus on gameplay and describing the scoring system with an eye toward observer education
<br />- Increased transparency</p>

<p>Thank you again to the five teams that did not get selected, we wish you the best of luck and success in your future contests.</p>

<p>And now without any further ado we would like to announce the new organizers!</p>

            <title>A Call from DC4420</title>
            <link>http://dc4420.org/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A message from our friends at dc4420.org, Subject: DC4420 - 2013 CFP</p>

<p>Hey! I know it's a bit late, but Happy New Year!</p>

<p>I've posted the dates for 2013 meetings on <a href="http://dc4420.org/">dc4420.org</a> but you'll notice there is very little else! That's because we still need talks!</p>

<p>For those that are yet to join us for our monthly gathering, the format is we meet in a private room in a pub, we have a 1 hour talk and a 20 minute talk on *any subject*, but hopefully something that is interesting to the 'hacker' community.... in the past we've had everything from reverse engineering Windows DEP to building your own Thermic Lance, so when I say any subject, I really do mean any subject that is either interesting or amusing or preferably both...</p>

<p>You will be speaking to a small crowd (normally between 60 and 100), so if you want to practice a talk that you're thinking of submitting to a 'real' conference, or you've already given it somewhere that a small section of London is unlikely to have attended, or you have an idea that you can cover in just 20 minutes and never really though of turning it into a talk, or you've never done any public speaking before then this is the place... you will be most welcome and someone may even buy you a nice warm beer!</p>

<p>We have the one-hour slot filled for January, but all others are currently open so don't be shy - send your submission to talks@dc4420.org...</p>

<p>All other details are here: <a href="http://dc4420.org/">http://dc4420.org/</a></p>

<p>I hope to see you there!</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>MM</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Discussions like this are what makes the DEF CON community great, and often lead to kind of innovative solutions you can only get from our attendees! Any ideas?</p>

<p>From Deviant Ollam on the DEF CON Forums:
<br />...I know for a fact that I'm not the only hacker with deaf friends, family, loved ones, etc. How many of you have deaf or hard-of-hearing people in your lives who might want to experience DEF CON?</p>

<p>What I am proposing in this thread is not a segregated or special area of any kind, a la DEF CON Kids, but simply I'm sort of putting out the call that "if you know deaf people who have thought about coming to DEF CON before, let's all try to make 2013 the year that they DO come for sure!"</p>

DEF CON, one of the worlds largest and longest running hacking conferences, celebrates it's 20th year with an energetic and appropriately themed compilation, entitled "XX". Founder and head of the conference Jeff Moss, also known as Dark Tangent, tasked DEF CON "goon" and Muti Music artist Great Scott with curating the talent filled track selections; acknowledging that music can be pure hacker fuel. Glitch-hop producers AMB, Mochipet and Cryptex play alongside a myriad of other genre-gurus  - including nerd-rockers Minibosses, tech-electro wizard High Sage, and nerdcore rap professionals MC Frontalot and Dual Core. Listening to this mix of hacker artists is like riding a wave of concentration as you find yourself zoning out to the ambient tones or letting the determining beats direct your fingers across the keyboard.<br><br>

One hundred percent of the proceeds from the sales go to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit agency that advocates digital rights and fights for the first amendment against egregious government bills like SOPA and the Cybersecurity Act of 2012. We urge you to purchase the DEF CON XX Compilation and spread the word to your friends and family.<br><br>

            <title>DEF CON Art Contest Returns!</title>
            <link>https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=12934</link>
            <description><![CDATA[This year's DEF CON art contest is going to be just a little different.</p>

First, you'll only have a few weeks to submit your masterpiece. All entries must be submitted by July 6th.  That's a lot less lead time, but we're pretty sure pressure sharpens the mind.</p>

<p>The theme is also going to be a little different. Since this is DEF CON's 20th anniversary, we're asking for poster-style artwork that imagines DEF CON 20 years from now. What do you think we'll be sharing with each other at DEF CON 40? What will hackery look like in 2032?  You're free to share your vision, whether you tend toward kittens and lollipops or brutal post-human hellscapes.  We'll share the best pieces with everyone through Facebook and the DEF CON website, and we'll post the winners in a prestigious spot at the con. So don't be shy - fire up your favorite digital artmaker and give your right brain a workout.</p>

<strong>Submission Deadline:</strong><br />
<p>All submissions must be received by July 6, 2012
<br />Submit entries to: neil [at] defcon dot org
<br />Submission info to include: Real name (your identity must be
<br />verifiable to collect a prize) and desired nick/handle if any; and a
<br />title and description of your piece.</p>

<strong>Additional Specs:</strong><br />
<p>Maximum poster size 11"x17". Final entries
<br />should be in 300pi minimum .tif or .jpg format. Vector entries can be in .ai or .eps format. Delivery is the responsibility of the entrant, if the entry is too large to email you may post it online for download.</p>

<strong>Prizes:</strong><br />
Entries will be judged together this year, with prizes for the top three finishers.<br /> <br />

<strong>1st Place:</strong> Two Free admissions to DEF CON 20, and a $200 credit at the DEF CON Swag Booth.<br /><br />

<strong>2nd Place:</strong> Free admission to DEF CON 20, and a $100 credit at the DEF CON Swag Booth.<br /><br />

<strong>3rd Place:</strong> Free admission to DEF CON 20, and a $50 credit at the DEF CON Swag Booth.<br /><br />]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>DEF CON is proud to announce the 2nd annual DEF CON awards ceremony, renamed the DC Recognize Awards.  These awards are given to deserving individuals in the community, industry, and media.  For DC20, we've shaken things up and included 7 different categories for your voting pleasure. Nominations will be held online, at SurveyMonkey, until <strong>July 10th</strong>.  From July 11th until the conference, the DEF CON Awards Selection Committee will review all the nominations for validity and evidence.  The top group of nominations that meet the nomination criteria, have the best justification, and are generally worthwhile will be presented for voting during the DEF CON Recognize Awards Ceremony at DEF CON.</p>

<p>All nominated individuals will be invited to the ceremony to receive their award in person, and provide a short "Thank you!" or "justification".  To ensure your nomination is not discarded, include as much vital information as possible for your nomination.  Links to stories, articles, media, or other evidence (product information, blogs, etc) should be included.  Be sure to attend the DC Recognize Awards Ceremony at DEF CON to vote for your choice in each of the 7 categories!
<br />		
<br />Your hosts again this year will be Jericho, Jeff Moss, and Russ Rogers.

            <title>&lt;em>Reboot&lt;/em> Sneak Preview at DEF CON 20!</title>
            <link>https://www.defcon.org/index.html#dc20reboot</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-20/reboot.jpg" alt="Reboot poster" /><br /><br />

<p>We are very excited to announce an Exclusive Sneak Preview screening of the film <em><a href="http://www.rebootfilm.com">Reboot</a></em> at DEF CON 20! Here is a peek at the premise from <a href="http://dailydead.com/interview-reboots-joe-kawasaki-and-sidney-sherman/">an article on the film</a>:</p>

<p> <em>"Set within a dystopian world that is a collision between technology and humanity, "Reboot" touches upon many of the current social and political concerns that arise from becoming more and more intertwined with the virtual.</p>

<p>In contemporary Los Angeles, a young female hacker (Stat) awakens from unconsciousness to find an iPhone glued to her hand and a mysterious countdown ticking away on the display. Suffering from head trauma, and with little recollection of who she is or what is happening, Stat races against time to figure out what the code means, and what unknown event the pending zero-hour will bring."</em></p>

<p>We are also excited that the filmmakers and lead cast members will be on hand at DEF CON for a Q&amp;A session along with the screening! We'll have more info as this solidifies.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a fun gaming challenge, <em>Reboot</em> has a cool alternate reality game in which you can participate as well! Find more info at <a href="http://www.rebootfilm.com/scoreboard">http://www.rebootfilm.com/scoreboard</a>.</p>

            <title>CODE 2600 Showing at DEF CON 20!</title>
            <link>https://www.defcon.org/index.html#dc20code2600</link>
            <description><![CDATA[DEF CON is happy to announce  Code 2600 will be showing at DEF CON 20! We will be the first hacker con to have the film shown and we are pretty excited about it. Like the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Code-2600/187282367978881">CODE 2600 Facebook page</a> for more info!</p>

<strong>About the film:</strong><br /><br />
CODE 2600 documents the rise of the Information Technology Age as told through the events and people who helped build and manipulate it. The film explores the impact this new connectivity has on our ability to remain human while maintaining our personal privacy and security.  As we struggle to comprehend the wide-spanning socio-technical fallout caused by data collection and social networks, our modern culture is trapped in an undercurrent of cyber-attacks, identity theft and privacy invasion. Both enlightening and disturbing, CODE 2600 is a provocative wake-up call for a society caught in the grips of a global technology takeover.<br /><br />

Not all presentations have PDF enclosures but we wanted to be complete and list every abstract and Bio we had for our speaker roster. As soon as we can encode and post the Audio and Video RSS we will, in the meantime, enjoy the <a href="https://www.defcon.org/podcast/defcon-19-materials.rss">DEF CON 19 Materials</a>.

            <title>Thanks for a Great Con!</title>
            <link>https://www.defcon.org</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Well another DEF CON has come and gone, and was it ever a great one! We'd like to give a huge shout out to all of you who attended and made it all worthwhile! Big thanks to all of the speakers, workshop instructors, contest/event &amp; village organizers, and vendors who provide so much awesome content for this con! Not to mention the multitudes of goons who make it all run like a well-oiled machine, as well as the fantastic staff at the Rio who went above and beyond for this unknown (to them) and crazy group of 11-12 thousand hackers! We are still reeling that the first year in a new hotel ran so smoothly!</p>

<p>We're back in the saddle now after a little much needed R&amp;R, so you can expect the content, press, contest results, and highlights to start rolling in over the next few days and weeks. In fact, it seems like the planning crew is already psyched and bursting at the seams with great ideas for next year, our 20th anniversary! Expect it to be epic!</p>

<p>Keep your eyes on the <a href="https://www.defcon.org/defconrss.xml" title="DEF CON RSS">DEF CON RSS</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_defcon_" title="DEF CON Twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/defcon" title="DEF CON Facebook Page">Facebook</a> pages for the latest updates as they roll in.

Back by popular demand, Skytalks returns for its fourth year of technical&nbsp;prowess, side-track talks, and semi-coherent rants by some of the legends&nbsp;of the community. Never mind that we aren't actually IN a skybox this year,&nbsp;we'll still fill it to capacity, have lines running down the hallways for&nbsp;three talks in advance, and we'll recapture that original Defcon spirit and&nbsp;party like it's 1992.

            <title>Stop. Think. Connect. A Special DHS, PSA Contest</title>
            <link>https://www.defcon.org</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Howard Schmidt, Special Assistant to the President and Cyber Security Coordinator has issued a special PSA Contest. This crowd sourcing campaign is in an effort to alert the general public to Stop, Think, then connect, when it comes to their online presence and responsibility. Good, Bad, or otherwise, I would really like to see what the DEF CON community came up with. <br />
<br />
I am confident that our DEF CON community could come up with some pretty interesting feedback in regards to this contest, I'd love to see and hear the creative ways you would advertise to the general public. I can only imagine the hilarity that would ensure in a minute for a video entitled "How to not be a Noob" or "Phishing &amp; Trolling, not what it was in Grandpa's day." Overall, I have had a love for PSA's since I was a kid. A lot of us remember and have a special place in our hearts for the PSA's of our youth, especially ones of the "The More you Know" variety. Who didn't like watching "This is your Brain on Drugs" or GI JOE telling us that bullying is wrong? I know I did, and "Knowing is Half the Battle".<br />
<br />
From the contest: <br />
<br />
"Keeping the Internet safe is a responsibility we all share. We need to take time to stop and think before we connect to the Internet, share information online, or participate in online communities.<br />
But sometimes, a creative and compelling reminder can help. That's why the Department has kicked-off the Stop. Think. Connect. PSA Challenge – because all Americans have an important role to play in securing the Internet.<br />
We are looking for videos that will help educate Americans about Internet safety and what we can all do to protect ourselves and our families online.<br />
If you know what it takes to get Americans motivated to improve their safety online, then we need your help.<br />
We want videos that inspire Americans to Stop. Think. Connect."<br />
<br />
For details on the requirements and how to submit visit the contest page at: <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/files/events/stop-think-connect-psa-challenge.shtm">http://www.dhs.gov/files/events/stop-think-connect-psa-challenge.shtm</a><br />
<br />
PSAs must include at least one of the following Internet safety tips: <br />
* Keep a Clean Machine<br />
 * Protect Your Personal Information<br />
 * Connect with Care<br />
 * Be Web Wise<br />
 * Be A Good Online Citizen<br />
<br />
   <br />
In similar fashion, I'd love to see if anyone out there posts something on: <br />
* Understanding Encryption<br />
* Surfing Anonymously<br />
* Using Proxy Servers or Feed Over Email<br />
* Understanding Copyright, TOS agreements, and Privacy expectations.<br />
* Who and What is a Troll and how to defeat them. <br />
<br />
This past year we had a few talks both in the offense and defense perspectives, check them out on the DC 18 archive, there are too many that fit this topic to list, you might find something that inspires you. I hope you guys &amp; gals out there send in a submission, if you don't want to submit to the official contest, can you send us a link instead? These PSAs would be great to show at DEF CON 19, and if we can, we'd probably like to share some of your clips online so we can get the word out to  "Stop. Think. Connect" The contest runs until Feb 14th, Valentines day, so send in your love, send us links, let's get this PSA party started. <br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<br />
The US electricity infrastructure relies on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) for better efficiency and reliability. However, these systems are susceptible to cyberattacks, which may disrupt essential power services. How cybercriminals rationalize target selection and attack technique is vital in offering a more comprehensive picture of ICS vulnerabilities, cybercrimes, and security. This Rutgers School of Criminal Justice PhD dissertation research project will survey both ethical hackers and industry representatives. It will assess their views on cybervulnerabilities of the electricity sector’s ICS to identify any gaps in their perceptions.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Be The Match offers the unique opportunity for you to give a life-saving marrow transplant to someone in need.  Thousands of patients with leukemia and other life-threatening diseases depend on the Be The Match Registry, the largest and most diverse registry in the worlds, to find a life-saving donor. The more potential donors that step forward, more resources are available to patients and more lives can be saved. <br />
<br />
&lt;strong>Description of the donor recruitment drive:&lt;/strong><br />
Be The Match will have a booth at DefCon 18 where individuals can register to be part of the Be The Match Registry.  All they need to be is between the ages of 18 and 60, meet the health guidelines and be willing to donate to ANY patient in need.  At the recruitment drive, you will fill out a consent form with contact information and a short medical evaluation.  You will receive more information about what it means to be a donor and then you will swab the inside of your cheeks.  Your tissue type will be listed in the Be The Match Registry until your 61st Birthday.  If you are a match for someone in need, then you will be contacted for donation.]]></description>

            <title>DEF CON 18 Contest Madness!</title>
            <link>https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-18/dc-18-news.html#dc18contestmadness</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Over the past week or two, we've had a flood of announcements for new contests! Check them out below!<br />
<br />
  <strong><a href="https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=518">Dark Tangent's Tamper Evident Contest</a></strong><br />
 There are various tamper evident technologies out there, including tape, seals, locks, tags, and bags, to name a few. This contest will test your ability to perform "defeats" (Described below) against a range of inexpensive commercial low to medium security products.<br />
<br />
  <strong><a href="https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=520">Backdoor Hiding Contest</a></strong><br />
 Two in one Backdoor Hiding/Finding Contest (participate in either or both): In the first stage, hiding participants provide a source code hiding a backdoor, in the second stage organizers mix the source codes with non-backdoored (placebos), and then ask finding participants to spot the placebos. Hiding participants get hiding points for being voted as a placebo and finding participants get points for spotting the placebos and negative points for false positives.<br />
<br />
  <strong><a href="https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=519">KoreLogic's "Crack Me If You Can" Contest</a></strong><br />
 As a part of an authorized penetration test of a large corporate network, you have captured a large number of passwords hashes. The hashes are from Active Directory, UNIX systems, LDAP servers, routers, etc. As part of your analysis, your client has asked for password complexity statistics, what their users are doing right and/or wrong related to generating passwords, and identification of weak passwords. You only have 48 hours to complete this effort.]]></description>

As the winter snows begin to melt, revealing a landscape full of promise and hope, a hacker’s thoughts turn to flights of fancy: specifically, the thought of being in Las Vegas during the last weekend in July.<br />
<br />
If you’re one of those hackers and you love digital freedom, EFF would like your help spreading the word about our efforts to protect and defend coders’ rights by encouraging your friends and neighbors to join you in supporting us.

            <description><![CDATA[From the DEF CON Forums:<br>
<br>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
<br>
1 APRIL 2010<br>
<br>
DEFCON CTF QUALIFIER ANNOUNCED<br>
<br>
Defense Diutinus Technologies Corp (ddtek) is pleased to announce the round of qualification for DEFON 18 CTF.<br>
<br>
Stock up on Red Bull, put the pizza delivery on speed dial, polish up your fancy shellcodes, and replenish the duct tape supply. The competition for these coveted spots will be held over 55 non-stop hours 21-24 May. When the dust clears only the 10 best will be invited to join us this summer in sin city for the annual DEFCON deathmatch.<br>
<br>
In historical fashion VedaGodz will be automatically be permitted contest entry. However, we wish to point out that real ninjas would still attempt to qualify.<br>
<br>
The qualification round will again be in the style of game board, but answers need not be in the form of a question. Categories will require teams to demonstrate the superiority of hacking across a vast realm of security. This isn't CTF like your mama used to make. Level 1 questions make CISSPs turn red, Level 2 make SANS Fellows cry in frustration, Level 3 are typically only answerable by sheep of above average barnyard intelligence, you get the idea.<br>
<br>
Pause your atari emulator and hop over the ddtek.biz to register. Only those that pre-register are permitted to play.<br>
<br>
Registration site: <a href="http://ddtek.biz/register.html">http://ddtek.biz/register.html</a><br>
Registration opens: 01 Apr 2010 00:00:00 UTC<br>
Registration ends: 20 May 2010 00:00:00 UTC<br>
<br>
Qualifications open: 21 May 2010 19:00:00 UTC<br>
Qualifications ends: 24 May 2010 02:00:00 UTC<br>
<br>
<br>
More information that will follow via your registered email address.<br>
<br>
Those with SANS certs need not apply. CISSPs are right out.*<br>

            <link>https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=507</link>
            <description><![CDATA[DC949, the creators of the Open CTF Contest (formerly Amateur CTF), after five long years have decided to step down as organizers.  DEF CON would like to thank them for all of their hard work over the last five years in making a contest that was not only fun, but also open to all who'd like to test the waters of Capture the Flag type competition.<br />
<br />
They have passed the torch to a team that has competed in their contest many times, TubeWarriors. Welcome TubeWarriors, we wish you luck!<br />
<br />

            <link>https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=11190</link>
            <description><![CDATA[With the electronic DEFCON badge now in its fifth incarnation, we've decided to try something different. We're opening our kimono (just slightly) for DEFCON attendees, groups, villages, or contest organizers who want to integrate some piece of information or hide some piece of data in the badge to help further their cause during the con. For example, maybe your contest wants to hide a clue on the badge and then contestants have to find it in the code or press a certain button to reveal it... <a href="https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=11190" title="DEF CON 18 Badge Call for Integration thread">Read more on the DEF CON Forums</a>. Submissions are due by April 1, 2010.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[As some of you may know, One of our speakers Thomas Wilhelm was recently a bone marrow donor from the Be the Match program. He contacted us about setting up a registry drive at Defcon 18. We like that Idea and are going to do what we can to make sure they have the space they need in order to grow their donor registry.

            <title>Pricing for DEF CON 18</title>
            <link>https://www.defcon.org/index.html#dc18price</link>
            <description><![CDATA[As the CPU cycles of DEF CON 18 Planning begin to rise toward 100%, we wanted to inform you that the price of admission will be rising slightly for DEF CON 18 to $140 USD due to price increases in the cost of doing business in Las Vegas and Washington State. The economy is in a slump, but don't tell the tax crazy cities that!<br />
<br />
I can't afford that, you say? You could offset this modest bump in price if you were to save an extra 10¢ per day from now until con. That's what, one can of Jolt Cola per week?  For almost four days of some of the most groundbreaking talks, contests, events and hacker social funtime around?  Check the newspaper coin returns, look under your couch cushions, keep your eyes on the ground for change! You'll find that extra $20, and it'll be worth it!<br />
<br />
We are planning to make DEF CON bigger and better than previous years, with a new "No Drama Badge&trade;" to keep you out of lines and in action. So keep watch on <a href="https://www.defcon.org" title="DEF CON Website">defcon.org</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/_defcon_" title="DEF CON Twitter">DEF CON Twitter</a> for news of the surprises we have in store!]]></description>

            <title>Don't miss NIST's Hack the Quantum at DEFCON 17!</title>
            <link>https://www.defcon.org</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Hack the Quantum<br />
<br />
Presented by the Joint Quantum Institute, National Institute of Standards and Technology and University of Maryland, and the Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore<br />
<br />
With a hands-on Bell-o-meter for entangled photons you can convince yourself that there are quantum effects beyond classical physics: a real qubit is offered to the participant who achieves the strongest violation of a Bell inequality. We also present a fresh attack that breaks many current quantum crypto systems, and demonstrate a photon-based quantum randon number generator.<br />
<br />
Find it in Capri 114 /115 Friday-Sunday at DEFCON 17!]]></description>

They have opted, pending acceptance from Apple, to make the app available via ad-hoc distribution, and will be accepting requests by email until Wednesday, July 29th at 9am PDT.  The method, contact info, and possible risks are clearly outlined at <a href="http://www.group6.net/AdHoc.html" title="DEFCON iPhone App AdHoc ">http://www.group6.net/AdHoc.html</a><br>

            <title>Hacker Jeopardy is Looking for Team Sign Ups</title>
            <link>https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=453</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a href="https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=10575">From G Mark on the DEFCON Forums</a>:<br />

<br />

THE PROPER (AND ONLY) WAY TO SIGN UP A TEAM FOR HACKER JEOPARDY<br />

<br />

Okay, just to make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity, here are the directions to sign up your team. Don't do something else (like post a reply to Winn's thread, since it might not get read in time -- we had this problem last year.)<br />

<br />

1. Open an e-mail to "hackerjeopardy@gmail.com"<br />

<br />

2. Include your TEAM NAME and the real names and handles of your three (3) team players. (Privacy policy: we protect your identity unless a Fed or someone with a whole bunch of cash wants it.)<br />

<br />

3. Explain why you are 31337 enough to play this year. Brag like you're trying to get lucky.<br />

<br />

4. Include at least one cellphone number so we can contact you to notify if you're playing or there's a problem with your entry.<br />

<br />

5. Send the e-mail as soon as possible, but absolutely no later than 90 minutes before the scheduled start of the round to be played. In case of any dispute, you're wrong (unless you are an entity described in #2 above.)<br />

            <description><![CDATA[Qualifiers - July 17-18<br />

Get your teams together and mark your calendar. Qualifiers will be the evenings of July 17-18. As teams sign up, we'll work with the team captains to finalize scheduling. Also, we'll group the individual reg's together into teams for the quals as well.<br />

<br />

If you haven't signed up, please do so sooner rather than later. NOTE you don't need a full team to sign up a team. If you've got 4 or 5 friends you want to play with, register a team and we'll fill the blanks up with individual reg's later.<br />

            <title>Coffee Wars Call for Beans</title>
            <link>http://www.coffeewars.org/CallForBeans.shtml</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.coffeewars.org/CallForBeans.shtml">http://www.coffeewars.org/CallForBeans.shtml</a><br />

<br />

From shrdlu on the DEFCON Forums:<br />

<br />

Information for those hoping to win on our momentous Tenth Year of celebrating caffeine.<br />

<br />

You can submit your beans before Friday morning, by various arcane methods, none of which will be posted here (but email to Foofus might help). You *MUST* submit them before 10AM (or close to it), since that's when we start brewing and drinking and judging. We'll send the occasional messenger out into the massed and frightening horde if you are trying to bring it Friday morning.<br />

<br />

Coffee Wars only takes place on Friday morning. We're usually done by 11-ish, and vanished completely by Noon. You can spot most of the judges the rest of the day due to the slight vibration of their entire body (except me; I *like* that much caffeine).]]></description>

            <link>https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-17/dc-17-index.html</link>
            <description><![CDATA[In the past, we have usually opened up registration and swag midday Thursday for those early birds that want to get a jump on things before the con officially starts. There are also a few unofficial events and gatherings, like the Toxic BBQ and theSummit, that make Thursday almost an extra day of DEFCON.<br />
<br />
This year, we're packing even more goodness into Thursday's activities, with a half day track of talks aimed at the DEFCON newb.  These talks will cover everything from basic hacking skills to what our beloved con is about, and how to get the most out of it.  If you are new to DEFCON, or feel like you could get more out of it, this "basic training" will be an invaluable resource!<br />
<br />
In addition, the Chill Out Area will be open for hanging out and the infamous DEFCON wireless network will be up and running, so you can pwn or be pwned right out of the gate!<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for a complete listing of all the great talks planned for Thursday, and as always, you can get instant updates as they occur by following the <a href="https://twitter.com/_defcon_">DEFCON Twitter feed</a>!]]></description>

<a href="http://www.rivierahotel.com/resnet/roomres.asp?ID=309">http://www.rivierahotel.com/resnet/roomres.asp?ID=309</a><br><br>

If you booked under the old prices I _think_ the pricing will automagically be reflected in your bill as the new room block price.<br>
<br>
2 - We will get the pool to 11pm for swimming and hanging out. We can do low key DJ action till then. We are currently talking with them to determine how we can keep it longer.<br>
<br>
3 - Drink prices on beer and booze have been reduced. I'll update this post when I have accurate information.<br />
<br />
We'll post more updates and details as they become available!]]></description>

<strong>Dark monks of techno-fu, it is that time of the year again! The DEFCON CFP is now open!</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>What:</strong> DEFCON 17 Call For Papers<br>
<strong>When:</strong> The Call for Papers will close on May 15, 2009<br>
<strong>How:</strong> Complete the <a href="dc-17-cfp-form.html" title="DEFCON 17 Call for Papers Form">Call for Papers Form</a> and send to talks at defcon dot org<br>
<br>
Don't know what DEFCON is? Go to www.defcon.org and clue up!<br>
<br>
Papers and presentations are now being accepted for DEFCON 17, the conference your mother and ISC(2) warned you about. DEFCON will take place at the Riviera in Las Vegas, NV, USA, July 31 - August 2, 2009.<br>
<br>
Two years ago we eliminated specific speaking tracks and we received a diverse selection of submissions. From hacking your car, your brain, and CIA sculptures to hacking the vote, Bluetooth, and DNS hacks. We will group presentations by subjects and come up with topic clusters of interest. It worked out so well in the past we are doing it again this year.<br>
<br>
What are we looking for then, if we don't have tracks? Were looking for the presentation that you've never seen before and have always wanted to see. We are looking for the presentation that the attendees wouldn't ask for, but blows their minds when they see it. We want strange demos of Personal GPS jammers, RFID zappers, and HERF madness. Got a MITM attack against cell phones? We want to see it.<br>
<br>
Subjects that we have traditionally covered in the past, and will continue to accept include: Trojan development, worms, malware, intelligent agents, protocol exploits, application security, web security, database hacking, privacy issues, criminal law, civil law, international law/treaties, prosecution perspectives, 802.11X, bluetooth, cellular telephony protocols, privacy, identity theft, identity creation, fraud, social implications of technology, media/film presentations, firmware hacking, hardware hacking, embedded systems hacking, smartcard technologies, credit card and financial instrument technologies, surveillance, counter-surveillance, UFO's, peer2peer technologies, reputation systems, copyright infringement and anti-copyright infringement enforcement technologies, critical infrastructure issues, physical security, social engineering, academic security research, PDA and cell phone security, EMP/HERF weaponry, TEMPEST technologies, corporate espionage, IDS evasion.<br>
<br>
What a mouth full! Well you can't say we didn't give you some ideas. This list is not intended to limit possible topics, merely to give examples of topics that have interested us in the past, and is in fact the same list we used last year..<br>
<br>
Check out <a href="../defcon-16/dc-16-speakers.html">https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-16/dc-16-speakers.html</a> for past conference presentations to get a complete list of past topics that were accepted if you want to learn from the past.<br>
<br>
We are looking for and give preference to: unique research, new tool releases, Ø-day attacks (with responsible disclosure), highly technical material, social commentaries, and ground breaking material of any kind. Want to screen a new hacking documentary or release research? Consider DEFCON.<br>
<br>
<strong>Speaking Formats:</strong><br>
<br>
 Choose between 12 hundred seconds, 50 minutes, 110 minutes, 1/2 day Thursday or a break out format of a length you determine.<br>
<br>
We are continuing the Twelve Hundred Second Spotlight, which is a shorter presentation (about twenty minutes) that doesn't warrant a full 50 or 110 minute talk. The Twelve Hundred Second Spotlight is designed for those who don't have enough material for a full talk, but still have a valuable contribution to make. This is to ensure that great ideas that can be presented quickly don't fall through the cracks merely because they didn't justify a full length talk. Examples include research, announcements, group presentations, projects needing volunteers or testers, requests for comments, updates on previously given talks, quick demonstrations. You get the idea. Presenters will get a speaker badge which entitles them to free admittance to DEFCON, but we will be unable to pay an Honorarium.<br>
<br>
Remember being attacked by Gran Master Ratt's Flame Crotch™? Do you remember thick accented Germans trying to convince you to attack critical infrastructure? Do you remember extravagant vapor ware releases by a stage filled with posses? We do, and sans projectiles of raw meat we want to encourage such shenanigans again this year. We are calling on all "hacker groups" (you know who you are, and the FBI has a nifty file with your name on it) to present at DEFCON, to discuss what you're up to, what your mission is, to discuss any upcoming or past projects, and to discuss parties/conferences you are throwing. We do humbly request that all gang warfare be relegated to electronic attacks, and not fall over into meat space.<br>
<br>
<strong>New for DEFCON 17:</strong><br>
<br>
    
  
    <strong>NEW</strong> this year is a 1/2 day set of tracks on Thursday, pre-con, to help orient newbies and provide 1/2 day training on different 'foundational' subjects such as networking, building custom Linux distros, a work shop on modding your PSP, the fundamentals of radio, things like that. These sessions will get you in the mood for the main conference and give you something to do if you showed up early Thursday. As such your submissions for the Thursday sessions should be entertaining and help attendees who are fairly new get their feet under themselves, or give more advances hacker types a half day of fun gutting their TiVo.<br>
    <br>If you want to present a 1/2 day training or newbie talk just make sure you mark down you want to present on Thursday.<br>
  <br>
  We have ALL the speaking rooms this year, and because of this I want to announce a call for workshops, demos, and mini trainings. We have additional small rooms that will enable highly focused demonstrations or workshops. If you want to talk about building a passport cloner or a tutorial on developing Metasploit exploits this might be the format for you. You tell us how much time you need, and we try to accommodate you!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>To submit a speech:</strong><br>
<br>
 Complete the <a href="dc-17-cfp-form.html" title="DEFCON 17 Call for Papers Form">DEFCON 17 Call for Papers Form</a>.<br>
  <br>We are going to continue last year's goal of increasing the quality of the talks by screening people and topics. I realize you guys are speaking for basically free, but some talks are better than others. Some people put in a bit more effort than others. I want to reward the people who do the work by making sure there is room for them.<br>
  <br>This year we will have two rounds of speaker acceptance. In the first round we will fill about half of the schedule before the submission deadline, and the remaining half afterwards. This is to encourage people to submit as early as possible and allows attendees to plan on the topics that interest them. If you see the schedule on-line start to fill, do not worry if you have not heard from us yet, as we are still in the process of selection.<br>
  <br>Barring a disaster of monstrous proportions, speaker selection will be completed no later July 1. The sooner you submit the better chance you have of the reviewers to give your presentation the full consideration it warrants. If you wait until the last minute to submit, you have less of a chance of being selected.<br>
  <br>After a completed CFP form is received, speakers will be contacted if there are any questions about their presentations. If your talk is accepted you can continue to modify and evolve it up until the last minute, but don't deviate from your accepted presentation. We will mail you with information on deadlines for when we need your presentation, to be burnt on the CDROM, as well as information for the printed program.<br>
  <br>Speakers get in to the show free, get paid (AFTER they give a good presentation!), get a coolio badge, and people like you more. Heck, most people find it is a great way to meet people or find other people interested in their topics. Speakers can opt to forgo their payment and instead receive three human badges that they can give to their friends, sell to strangers, or hold onto as timeless mementoes. Receiving badges instead of checks has been a popular option for those insisting on maintaining their anonymity.<br>

            <title>Call for Updates: Unofficial DEFCON FAQ</title>
            <link>https://forum.defcon.org/blog.php?b=101</link>
            <description><![CDATA[From HighWiz on the DEFCON Blogs:<br />
<br />
The original "Unofficial DefCon FAQ" wasn't the work of one single individual but a collaboration by many people. I view my role as more of an organizer of the information rather than the creator of it.<br />
<br />
Version 1.0 is seriously outdated, <a href="http://defcon.stotan.org/faq/"> http://defcon.stotan.org/faq/</a> and in need of a refresh. So I figured I'd utilize this blog space to request feedback on version 2.0 .<br />

            <description><![CDATA[Due to overwhelming feed back for the positive, the DEFCON Forums are now strictly SSL. This change has enabled us to utilize page compression which was previously unavailable, which speeds up page delivery.  It will also enhance security, since the all sessions will now be encrypted. <br />
<br />
If you haven't already joined the DEFCON Forums, you should, it's a great place to keep in touch with the DEFCON community and to be a part of the discussion and planning leading up to the next DEFCON! <br />

            <title>Poll: Should DEFCON Forums go SSL Only?</title>
            <link>https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=9967</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<b>Get over to the DEFCON Forums and weigh in on whether or not they should only be accessible over an SSL connection. If you are a forums member, there is a handy poll in which you can vote.  If you're not a member, SIGN UP!</b><br><br>

From DT on the DEFCON Forums:<br><br>

Hey everyone, I'd like everyone's input on switching forum.defcon.org over to SSL only. Brief background:<br><br>

The way we do redirection from http to https is a clever kludge Cot came up with, but it prevents us from using http compression, which would speed things up for everyone. Now that mobile devices have supported http compression for years we may as well take advantage of it, not to mention it would be like getting extra free capacity.<br><br>

With SSL only some of the XSS and related attacks would be more difficult and MITM concerns would almost vanish.<br><br>

The downside is some people might not be able to log in through proxies (I can over Tor, though), at free WiFi locations, etc.<br>

            <title>First Interview since silenced subway hacking talk</title>
            <link>http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4278892.html?page=1</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Popular Mechanics has interviewed Zack Anderson, one of the silenced MIT Students who were to give the Anatomy of a Subway Hack talk at DEFCON 16. <br />
<br />
From Popular Mechanics:<br />
<br />
Its rare that a hacker convention makes national news, but three MIT students caused a whole lot of controversy when they planned a presentation about security holes in Boston's subway system for DefCon in Las Vegas earlier this month. They were forced to cancel the talk at the last minute by a 10-day federal restraining order, requested by Boston's Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA). On Tuesday, a judge denied motions by the MBTA to issue a preliminary injunction aimed at keeping the students quiet for a further five months. Now, in his most extensive interview to date, MIT subway hacker Zack Anderson talks with PM about what's wrong with the Charlie Card, what happened at DefCon, and what it's like to tango with the FBI and the MBTA. <br />

            <description><![CDATA[From CNET.com:<br />
<br />
BOSTON--The three Massachusetts Institute of Technology students who have been barred by a court order from discussing subway card vulnerabilities are now free to say what they want.<br />
<br />
In a ruling certain to be cheered by computer researchers, a federal judge here Tuesday let the 10-day-old gag order expire. U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. refused to grant a preliminary injunction requested by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority that would have blocked the students from talking about their findings until January 1, 2009.<br />
<br />
The MBTA's requested injunction would have replaced a temporary restraining order granted during the Defcon hacker conference, which under federal court rules automatically expires on Tuesday.<br />

            <title>New Happenings at DEFCON 16</title>
            <link>http://www.defcon.org</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Well folks, the time for the 16th installment of the hacking convention known as DEFCON draws near, and this year promises to be a great one! We've got more content than ever, including 5 full tracks of talks, demos, workshops, new contests, a new Hardware Hacking Village, and even a new EFF fundraiser to replace the dunk tank! Here is some of the goodness you can expect:<br>
<br><b>
DAVIX Visualization Workshop</b><br>
At this "Bring Your Own Laptop" workshop we will introduce you to DAVIX. The workshop starts with an introduction to the set of available tools, the integrated manual, as well as customizing the CD to your needs. In a second part, you can use DAVIX to analyze a set of provided packet captures. In the end we will show some of the visualizations created by the participants. Be prepared for pretty and meaningful pictures! Get more info at: <a href="https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=425">https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=425</a><br>
<br><b>
Mobile Hacker Spaces</b><br>
Interested in visiting a Colorado Hacker Space here at DefCon 16?  Check out the first ever Mobile Hacker Space, which will be parked in the outside chill out area during the convention.  Try your hand against one of the challenges in the pentest lab, or learn from the web-based tutorials posted on the open network.  Participation is encouraged, and presentations will be given every day from 2-4pm, which will provide a more hands-on look at how the Mobile Hacker Space operates and fits within published hacker space design patterns.  Make sure you also attend the presentation on the history and design of the Colorado Springs Mobile Hacking Space on Sunday, at 1pm in Track One.

<br><b>
Quantum Spookshow</b><br>
Quantum mechanics make possible some things that are impossible in the "classical" world of ordinary experience, and which even seem to contradict common sense.  Some of these spooky effects are coming into practical use in security applications.  The Quantum Spookshow of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National University of Singapore (NUS) demonstrates quantum cryptography and quantum entanglement on a four-node quantum network, which supports quantum encrypted streaming video and violations of local realism. Participants are encouraged to interact with the light beams that constitute the physical link of this network, and to meet physicists who have designed and built quantum networks.  Quantum mechanics provides methods of encryption that are secure from eavesdropping attacks against the quantum channel, but in any actual system there are points of vulnerability, e.g. correlations of classical noise in the operation of quantum elements.  Participants will have a chance to discover vulnerabilities by hands-on interaction with our systems.<br>
<br>
Hours: 10:00-18:00 on Friday and Saturday with Sunday, closing around 16:00<br>
Location: 114. Directly across from the Contest area.<br>
<br><b>
EFF Fundraiser</b><br>
This year we decided to replace our beloved Dunk Tank with something NEW!<br>
Hackers and Guns in Las Vegas – Ya gotta love it.<br>
 <br>
You've seen it played out numerous times in movies and on TV.  A flash bang grenade goes off. SWAT kicks in the door and moves quickly to differentiate between the good guys and the bad guys in the same room. How do they train to effectively recognize and take out the bad guys, while not wasting any of the hostages?  One of the tools they use is a Firearms training Simulator or FATS system and someone was foolish enough to let us get our hands on one for DEFCON 16.<br>
 <br>
So… Calling all Shooters, FPS Gamers, Psycho Killers, and 1337 wannabes. Come on by and pop a cap in someone’s VR ass.  We will be set up in room 115 across from the contest area and next door to the Quantum Spookshow from 10:00 – 20:00. See if you got the skillz to make it through the challenges unscathed. Then the next time you hear a knock at your door in the middle of the night - you'll be ready.

            <title>The DEFCON Shoot is Back!</title>
            <link>http://deviating.net/firearms/decfon_shoot/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[From the DEFCON Shoot Page on Deviating.net:<br>
<br>
The DEFCON Shoot is a public event happening just prior to the DEFCON hacker conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. Anyone who wants to can show up and for a small fee make use of a private range located about 30 minutes outside of the city. There will be opportunities to see and possibly shoot some of the weapons belonging to your friends and it will also be possible to rent firearms (including Class-III full autos) from the range itself. In addition to having a number of terrific pieces of hardware on-site, the range is directly affiliated with Small Arms Review Magazine and thus has access to their nearly limitless archive of equipment. Anything from a WWII Bren Gun to a Vulcan Cannon-style Minigun is possible.<br>
<br><b>
As of right now, the event's ability to come off is contingent on participation...</b> that means that we need you if we're going to make it happen. I have run the numbers, and I can acquire us private range time at a very sweet facility if we have about a little over two dozen people showing up, provided that about at least ten of them are interested in some full-automatic action. Read on for more details about location, pricing, etc.<br>

            <link>https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=369</link>
            <description><![CDATA[There will be one wildcard (walk-on) team allowed this year. Each year I have people asking about the contest after it is too late. This is my means of dealing with those people. Keep in mind that the first year Mystery Challenge ran a walk-on team won the competition.<br />
<br />
Friday morning I will be accepting intentions to compete. THIS MAY CHANGE TO THURSDAY NIGHT. If only one team shows for this position, it is theirs. If multiple teams show, there will be a mini-challenge race to determine who gets the spot.<br />
<br />
Anyone who intends to try for the walk on team should email me their intentions prior to con if possible. (DC16MysteryChallenge [at] MysteryChallenge ]dot[ org. This will help me gauge the magnitude of the mini-challenge race, if necessary (and it just helps me get an idea of the number trying out).<br />
<br />
See you all in a few weeks.<br />

            <title>Defcon Goon: Speaker Operations: Call for Volunteers</title>
            <link>https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=9474</link>
            <description><![CDATA[From Agent X on the DEFCON Forums:<br />
<br />
The few, the proud (arrogant?) ,the insane? Yes, that's right Speaker Operations a subset of the Defcon Goon Squad is looking for a few good folks. Speaker Operations goons are the blue shirts that ferry speakers to and from stage, keep the speaking schedule in order, and generally try to make the talks not suck...<br />
Sometimes we succeed, sometimes we fail, generally there is beer at the end.<br />
In an effort to ensure a healthy supply of goons for future Defcons, I'm holding semi-formal auditions/interviews this year at Defcon 16.<br />
<br />
So if you interested in joining the ranks of the Defcon Speaker Operations Goons squad, here's what you've got to do:<br />
<br />
* Write me an email, telling my why you will rock speaker operations. (In a good way).<br />
* Demonstrate your resourcefulness by tracking me down and arranging a time for us to talk at Defcon this year. Make it memorable...it's a busy con you know.<br />
* Demonstrate to the speaker operations staff those blue shirted goons again, you know why they are so awesome (?!Schwag, beer?!)<br />
<br />
Thank you for your interest.<br />
Agent X<br />

            <description><![CDATA[This year on Friday night we will be screening a documentary, Hackers Are People Too, which will end before the director/producer needs to participate in Hacker Jeopardy. Then we will move on to some Blu-Ray goodness of "Appleseed Ex-Machina" for the latest in cg anime from Japan.<br />
<br />
Saturday evening we will go retro with "Three Days of the Condor", where you can see an early Robert Redford deal with spies, telephones, and intrigue. For those who have seen 'safehouse' you'll recognize a scene for scene rip off homage to "Condor" Then we'll close with as of yet TBD movie...<br />

            <title>Beverage Cooling Contraption Contest on Hack A Day!</title>
            <link>http://www.hackaday.com/2008/05/28/beverage-cooling-contraption-contest/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The BCCC run by Deviant Ollam has popped up on hackaday.com!<br />
<br />
From the article:<br />
<br />
Let's face it: no one likes warm beer. In the arid August air of Las Vegas, though, it's difficult to get anything else. To combat this problem, Deviant has hosted a competition the last three years at Defcon called the Beverage Cooling Contraption Contest, or BCCC. We're not talking about something as simple as a Coleman cooler or even a peltier cooler: the devices entered in this contest have to be able to take a beer from hot to cool and your glass within minutes.<br />
<br />

            <title>Race to Zero Makes Headlines</title>
            <link>http://www.racetozero.net</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Race-to-Zero anti-virus challenge was announce scarcely a week ago, and already the controversy surrounding it has bubbled all the way up to Wired.  The contest's basic premise is that competitors will be given sample virus code and rewarded for modifying that code in such a way that it defeats common AV products.  <br /><br />
AV vendors have made their discomfort with the idea clear, with various spokesmen for the industry voicing concern about the creation of new threats to existing AV products.  Contest organizers have countered that the contest is categorically not about creating new virii, rather it is about demonstrating the speed with which currently blocked virii can be modified to defeat current virus-blocking software.<br />
<br />
While it's important to note that while the contest will be happening at this year's DEFCON, it is not an official DEFCON contest.  To learn about the contest from its creators and organizers, please check their website at www.racetozero.net.  <br />

            <link>https://forum.defcon.org/showthread.php?t=9256</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Check out this new contest brewing for DEFCON 16!<br />
<br />
From the DEFCON Forums:<br />
The Race to Zero involves contestants being given a sample set of viruses and malcode to modify and upload through the contest portal. The portal passes the modified samples through a number of antivirus engines and determines if the sample is a known threat. The first team or individual to pass their sample past all antivirus engines undetected wins that round. Each round increases in complexity as the contest progresses.<br />

            <description><![CDATA[It's a little late, but it's never to early to start planning for next
year.  If you must get online at DEFCON, here's a little guide to help
keep you from getting completely owned.<br />
<br /><br />

>From The Register:<br />
"..Defcon, the most bacchanal of security conferences and perhaps the
single largest gathering of technically adept pranksters. Now is the
perfect time to map out a strategy for keeping emails private and making
sure your system doesn't get ransacked by the scowling kid with the nose
ring and jet-black hair."]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Many of you know Deviant Ollam, from his extensive involvement in the Lockpick Village and his running of the Beverage Cooling Contest, as well as his new "Titanium Chef" and "guess the Flesh" contests at the Toxic BBQ this year.  We came across a story about one of his projects and though we'd share.
<br />
>From tgdaily.com:<br />
A New Jersey network engineer is on a mission to send some love and care
– of the digital kind – to Americans stationed overseas.  Going by his
hacker handle ‘Deviant Ollam’, he’s been sending out hard drives filled
with popular movies, television shows and music for over a year.  Dubbed
the Traveling Terabyte Project (TTB), the drives have seen action in
war-torn countries and one set is now making a small contingent of
Marines very happy in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan.<br />

Many interesting things happened at this year's DEFCON, from the sensational hackable badge by Joe Grand to the eye-opening talk by Zac Franken on access control reader (in)security.  We blew the undercover reporter's cover, and we found out that a kid can bump a "bump-proof" deadbolt. We even married two Feds. What a year! Here are just a few of the headlines arising from DEFCON 15:<br />

                <br />
Joe Decided to drop us a line and clue send us some info on whats going on with the badges AFTER the con. We loved the badges this year and apparently we arent the only ones who found them awesome. <br />
<br />
>From Joe Grand<br />
<br />
"You've probably noticed that people are still going *nuts* over the badges. That's a really awesome feeling and hopefully there will be some of the 40 people who took components and development kits coming back next year with some radical hacks.<br />
<br />
Here are some pictures I took of the Black Hat and DEFCON conferences (and badge hacking):<br />

<br />
and here:<br />
http://www.flickr.com/photos/joesmooth/sets/72157601302838516/<br />
<br />
The badges have been selling like hot cakes on eBay:<br />
http://search.ebay.com/defcon-15<br />
Take a look at the completed listings, too, to see the high bidders!<br />
<br />
Also, there were TONS of blog and news reports about the badge. You've probably read most of them, but here are the ones I liked the best:<br />

<br />
<br />
I'll be putting up a webpage with complete badge development info, badge hacking contest results/hacks/source, etc. in the next week or so. It will be directly accessible from the main www.grandideastudio.com site for a while.<br />
<br />
Details on the winning badge hacking contest entry from Team Osogato can<br />
be found here: http://www.osogato.com/hacks  This was the only entry out<br />
of seven that combined hardware and firmware modifications - they hacked<br />
the badge into a line-level meter for under $10 that used the LED matrix<br />
to display the peak audio levels of an audio signal fed into one channel<br />
of the A/D. The two capacitive touch buttons are used to adjust the<br />
input levels of the signal and there are even three shades of<br />
"greyscale" for a fading effect on the LEDs. For the icing on the cake,<br />
the team worked with The Brothers Grimm from Michigan<br />
(http://www.myspace.com/CompleteError) to create a rap song based on my<br />
poem that I wrote for the DC15 program (on page 3). What an honor! The<br />
song is freely available at the Team Osogato link above and step-by-step<br />
hack details are forthcoming.<br />
<br />
Hope you guys are recovering!<br />
<br />
Joe"

            <title>World Premiere of Infest Wisely to be shown at DEFCON</title>
            <link>http://www.infestwisely.com/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[This year's DEFCON Movie Night will feature the new and highly buzz-worthy film "Infest Wisely." The film is centered around the increasingly less science-fictional world of commercial nanotechnology and it's been described this way:<br />

<br />
"Infest Wisely asks what would happen if Critical Mass teamed up with the geeks from DEFCON to stop commercialized nanotech from taking over our bodies and the world." 
<br />
<br />
It's a feature length movie in seven episodes, each with different directors but all written by novelist Jim Munroe, who will be our special guest for the screening. As always, there's no charge - come join us and support cinema licensed under the Creative Commons.
For more information about the film, you can check out it's website. http://www.infestwisely.com/]]></description>

Teams of up to three individuals will put their heads together and engage in heated battle to concoct a delicious dining experience focused around a secret theme ingredient.  These hacker chefs will have both their culinary skills and their organizational abilities put to the test in this challenging event.  All participants will gather together a few hours before the Toxic BBQ in order to witness the revealing of the event's secret ingredient, then they will disperse in order to gather 
supplies, reach Sunset Park, and prepare their food for the judges.

<br />
Whose cuisine will reign supreme?  Will opponents' grill-fu be stronger than you?  Participate and find out!

Have you ever thought to yourself, "Gee, i wish i could dine on the meat of nearly every kind of beast to walk the earth... but I don't own many high-powered firearms, i don't have the money to travel the world, and no government in their right mind would issue me a hunting license?" <br />
<br />
Well, now your dreams can become a reality.  For less than the cost of what passes for a movie and popcorn nowadays, you can have a sample platter featuring eight meats that you aren't likely to see at the supermarket.  However, instead of just cooking and randomly giving out 
samples willy-nilly, this year i have something new planned. I intend to prepare morsels of these meats and plate them in a way that they are not immediately identifiable or distinguishable from one another. Those who are eager to try some new flavors -- and those who think their pallets 
are up to the challenge -- can take a whack at identifying these various animals by taste and texture alone.

            <description><![CDATA[
                From IrishMASMS on the DEFCON forums comes this helpful post:<br /><br />

Las Vegas concerts for Black Hat & DEFCON time frame<br />

Some out of town folks hit me up asking about concerts around town during this year's Black Hat  andDEFCON. I took a quick look on http://pollstar.com/ and http://www.jambase.com/ for what might be interesting. YMMV, though I thought sharing is caring.
<br />
<br />
Fri 07/27/07 Violent Femmes Hard Rock Hotel and Casino
<br />
Fri 07/27/07 Jonny Lang House Of Blues
<br />
Sat 07/28/07 Tesla House Of Blues
<br />
Sat 07/28/07 Rush MGM Grand Garden Arena
<br />
Wed 08/01/07 John Lee Hooker Jr. Santa Fe Station Hotel & Casino
<br />
Thu 08/02/07 John Lee Hooker Jr. Boulder Station Hotel & Casino
<br />
Fri 08/03/07 Godsmack The Pearl Concert Theater At Palms
<br />
Sat 08/04/07 Buckcherry, Hinder, Papa Roach The Pearl Concert Theater At Palms
<br />
Sun 08/05/07 Against All Authority, Reel Big Fish / Less Than Jake, Streetlight Manifesto House Of Blues
<br />
Mon 08/06/07 "Sounds Of The Underground": Amon Amarth, Chimaira, Every Time I Die, GWAR, Heavy Heavy Low Low, Job For A Cowboy, Necro, Shadows Fall , The Devil Wears Prada, The Number Twelve Looks Like You - House Of Blues
<br />
Sat 08/11/07 The Fixx The Club @ Cannery Casino
<br />
<br />
As for venues, the Hard rock sucks. House of Blues is one of the best in town. MGM Grand is ok, but the sound quality in the arena can be shitty in spots. The Pearl is the brand new venue in town, good luck getting tickets. The Station casinos are not bad venues, and I think those are free shows. The Cannery Casino I have never been to, so I can not say - and there is no review posted on www.yelp.com yet for me to reference.
<br />
<br />
HTH!

                Scavenger Hunt! Advice from the Winners!! Free advice courtesy of hackajar with Vegas 2.0
<br />
Here's a quick list of things you will need to be fully geared up, if competing. I kinda wish we had something like this three years ago!<br/>
<br />
1.) Money - we spent ~$500 each year, though some good social engineering could very well fix this<br />
2.) Digital Camera - Judges won't know what you did, without proof!<br/>
3.) Video Camera - Sometimes a photo DOESN'T say a thousand words, but motion video does!<br />
4.) Transportation - Sometimes you have to go on recon, we always paid extra to have a car in front of valet for those quick runs<br />
5.) Room at Hotel - Need somewhere to build a 30ft straw or host a geek girl strip off, your best bet is in a local room<br />
6.) Printer - Don't ask me how many points we never got for lack of a stupid printer!<br />
7.) Beer - It's easy to bribe goons and judges with this stuff, if you can find it.<br />
8.) Start Early - Some items and tasks we could only do on Friday, remember things close on Saturday and Sunday, so be wise!<br />
9.) Memorize the phrase "It's for the Scavenger Hunt" - nuff said<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'm missing something else in there, please add to my list!<br/>

            <title>New "Be Prepared"- Lock Picking for Sport and Amusement</title>
            <link>https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-15/dc-15-beprepared.html</link>
            <description><![CDATA[
                Lock Picking for Sport and Amusement<br />
<br />
DEFCON is a great place to learn all sorts of new skills - the skill of lockpicking is no exception. This year's Con will again have a "Lockpicking Village" - a fantastic event with all kinds of presentations, practice locks, sample tools and general education. We want everyone who's interested to check it out, but we want you to be careful and safe as well.<br />
<br />
Be sure to consult your state and local laws about possession of locksmith's tools. Staying in compliance with the applicable laws is, of course, your responsibility. When traveling, it's not a good idea to put tools of this nature in your carryon. While they're unlikely to cause any problems in checked baggage, those pointy little devils are very likely to be a problem in the security line.<br />
<br />
It probably ought to go without saying, but if you're making an international trip to DefCon, the scrutiny is much higher and you owe it to yourself to be thoroughly familiar with the rules and err on the side of caution. You don't need that kind of hassle. There's plenty of lockpicking knowledge and fun to be had even without your k-rad tools, so don't put yourself in a position to miss your flight.<br />
<br />
It's also an option to mail them to yourself in care of your hotel. Some hotels charge for this service, so be aware of the policies wherever you're staying.<br /><br />


If the world of locksport is brand new to you and you're looking to get a little knowledge before the Con, you can check out Marc Weber Tobias' contributions to techblog Engadget (called The Lockdown.) More info is also available from Locksport International (lsi.com) or The Open Organization of Lockpickers ( toool.us or toool.nl for Dutch speakers)

            <description><![CDATA[
                From ownthebox.cipherpunx.org/:<br />
<br />
Are you a defensive ninja? Are your services unbreakable, your builds airtight? Do your countermeasures have countermeasures for counter-countermeasures?<br />
<br />
So prove it, bucko... Bet your box on it, on the most hostile network in the world.<br />
<br />
Bring your laptop/server/desktop, hardened to the nines, running exactly two (2) visible services, to our specs, and we'll offer you up for the slaughter.<br />
<br />
The first person to compromise you walks away with your gear. When you're 0wned, you're owned. It's that simple. The last box(en) standing, unowned, wins, and the winner(s) can take his/her precious back home, safe in the knowledge that if it survived at DC, it can survive anywhere.<br />
<br />
For the other side of the fence, the reward is clear... Pick your target, 0wn the box, and own the box. A shopping spree for the elite.

                Announcing The DefCon 15 Wireless Contest<br />(queue Thus Spake Zathrustra)<br />
<br />
Are you a freq-geek? Think your WiFiFu is hot? Get high from sniffing packets on the ether? Think you're a great lover? We can't help you with the last one, but get ready because here's your chance to prove the rest of those outlandish claims to the world.<br />
<br />
Compete in the Wireless Contest, and we can validate you self esteem, at least in the geeky stuff.<br />
<br />
The Wireless Contest, following the format for the past few years, will be a series of "Mini-Contests". You can compete in only a single mini-contest or all of them. We recommend that teams be formed to fill in different skill areas.<br />
<br />
We are allowing a unlimited number of Teams -subject to resources- limited to 3 people each.<br />
<br />
First Place winners of individual mini-contests events get prizes and with a top prize will be awarded for the best overall of the contests.<br />
<br />
A common problem with the Wireless Contest in the last few years, is that some potential competitors felt that they didn't have the skills to even try. As a result, fewer competitors kept signing up. To elevate this, the Wireless contest this year is tied in heavily with the Wireless Village. If you want to compete in the contest, but feel you don't have a needed skill, you can come to the Wireless Village before a mini-contest and learn the needed skill at the one of the Wireless Village's world-famous Breakout Sessions. You walk in having no skills but a willingness to learn, learn a skill in an exciting breakout session taught by an expert, then go out and compete and the beat the pants at those loudmouth teams who said they'd pwn you.<br />
<br />
Learn + Touch = DO! <br />

            <title>CTF Qualifications Are Complete!</title>
            <link>http://www.kenshoto.com/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[From invisigoth:<br />

The qualification round for this years CTF is complete. More than 150 teams were actually submitting answers which means that participation for this year was more than double the previous high water mark (as far as we're aware). Results may be found at http://www.kenshoto.com/ as always.<br />

<br />
This years challenges came in a wide range of technologies and difficulties. No single team actually solved them all... Additionally, this years level of international participation was staggering...
<br />

<br />
The MUD for this year will remain up for teams to ask questions and hopefully collaborate with each other about how they came to solutions for some of the harder challenges. Additionally, we will be putting most if not all of the challenges back online for a while so everybody can sharpen up... Stay tuned...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[
                From the site defconnetworking.org:<br><br>

"DefCon presents a really unique opportunity. You know how hostile the environment is. Have you ever wondered what that traffic looks like? All you need do is ask. For years we've provided people the ability to plug in a capture/sniffer box and capture public con traffic to take back to your Evil Laboratory(tm) for analysis after con (you know, once you've sobered up & stuff). If you want in on the action, email us so we can RSVP a spot for you on our Table-of-Doom in the NOC." 
<br>
TWO SLOTS LEFT!<br><br>

To get an Idea check out last years network: <br>
Here are the PPT slides from DC14 Closing Ceremonies with all the net stats: DC14network.ppt<br>
http://www.defconnetworking.org/dc14network.ppt<br>


Remember, if you're planning anything "special", have specific needs for your talk, for your demo, for your break-out session, let us know EARLY so we can plan for it. <br><br>


About Defcon Networking: <br>
We're the group of volunteers who run the network at DEFCON. It's our job to design, plan, architect, implement, and secure the show network. We arrange bandwidth, we handle wireless, we provide secure connections for show staff, speakers, and press. Finally, we provide an environment where DefCon Attendees can share and be creative.

DefCon presents a really unique opportunity. You know how hostile the environment is. Have you ever wondered what that traffic looks like? All you need do is ask. For years we've provided people the ability to plug in a capture/sniffer box and capture public con traffic to take back to your Evil Laboratory(tm) for analysis after con (you know, once you've sobered up & stuff). If you want in on the action, email us so we can RSVP a spot for you on our Table-of-Doom in the NOC.

Why yes, we are in the midst of planning for DC15. Now that we've "done the dance" with the hotel (who are awesome folks, btw!) we know what we can and can't do and should have virtually no surprizes this year. We're planning higher bandwidth, better monitoring, and also some new interactive-type stuff (I hesitate speaking of it for fear of jinxing it!). We're actually spending our funds boosting up our own infrastructure (beyond the Arbua kit we have) so we have more ports, better fibre connectivity, better trunking.
<br />
<br />
Remember, if you're planning anything "special", have specific needs for your talk, for your demo, for your break-out session, let us know EARLY so we can plan for it.

            <title>Announcing Amateur CtF 3 by DCG 949!</title>
            <link>http://www.dc949.org/aCTFIII/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[
                From the official web site for the Amateur CtF:<br />
<br />
aCTF 3
<br />
"King of the Hill"
<br />
<br />
Yes, it's official; we'll back again this year. The first year, nobody scored, the wifi network we set up had massive problems, but people seemed to have a little fun and see the potential. Last year, the network was stable, people scored, battled back and forth, and we were actually able to give out some prizes. There was some trouble with boxes staying up, but overall it was a huge success.
<br />
<br />
Last year we saw some things that surprised us. There was a case of two teams which both could take a flag, but neither could lock the other out. They both then proceeded to write scripts to play the game for them. Yeah, it then made the server inaccessible due to the massive amounts of requests, but still... hats off to both of you. We didn't expect automated hacking. We also learned that while Windows NT might have worked in our little test environment, it really can't hold up to the brutality of a Defcon contest. I'm happy to say that Windows NT will not be appearing in this year's contest.
<br />
<br />
We will be changing a few things around this year, but the basics will be the same as before. Find a flag, find a way to put your team name on it, and you'll score points for as long as you can keep your flag up there.
<br />
<br />
As usual, details on the contest will be limited, however we will say that we're branching out a bit more this year. Hacking isn't just about buffer overflows and running metasploit, it's really about one upping someone (or everyone) else. It's about figuring out how things work and taking them apart and putting them back together to do something different, customizing things to make them do things they were never intended to do, and just generally learning how to beat the system.

            <description><![CDATA[Kallahar has updated the software page for the DefConBots Contest.<br />

<br />
"Improvements over last year include faster response times and software alignment of the camera to where the gun is actually shooting.
<br />
<br />
All the code is public domain, do whatever you want with it!"<br />
<br />
What is the point of the contest you ask? Quite simple it is to ceate a computer controlled gun that can shoot down targets in a shooting gallery. <br />

            <title>NEW CONTEST! Guitar Hero II</title>
            <link>http://www.panadero.org/gh_home.html</link>
            <description><![CDATA[
                Guitar Hero II Contest!!<br>
<br>
A new contest at Defcon 15: Are you a Guitar Hero? Do your friends think you're l33t and can shred like a rock star? Then prove it!<br><br>Contest Site: http://www.panadero.org/gh_home.html<br>

Forums discussion: https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=335<br><br>
Guitar Hero II - DEFCON STYLE!!!!  Why Not!!!<br>
Rules (cause they tell us we have to have them...)<br>
   <br> * The contest will consist of 3 levels of play, Medium, Hard and Expert.
  <br>  * The contest will be played on Guitar Hero II, on the Xbox 360.
 <br>   * A initial pre qualification round will be held so that Experts aren't playing in the Medium level, etc...details of the prequals to come...
   <br> * All contestants should be at their assigned time to play 10 minutes before their time.  There will be some leeway if you are a few minutes late, but don't expect to get your turn if you show up hungover an hour after your time.
 <br>   * You may use your own guitar, as long as it has not been modified, and is for Xbox 360.
   <br> * Free play is a chance for people that have never played Guitar Hero to have a chance. It's not a chance for contestants to practice. This contest is for everyone, and we want to make sure that is the case. Free play will be limited to one song per person, depending on how many are waiting to play.
<br>
Scoring
<br>
<br>    * The 'prequals' will be designed to ensure that Experts are not playing in the Medium category, just to win.  We want the game to be fair, and everyone to have fun.  We would hate for the lesser/newer players to be upset and frustrated because it's dominated by those that have years of practice.
 <br>   * The 'heats' are designed to weed out the newbs from the Guitar Heroes.  Each player will play 2 songs, back to back, to come up with a cumulative high score.
  <br>  * The four highest scores will move to the finals for each level.
  <br>  * The finals will be tournament style, head to head, most points win and move to the final song.
   <br> * The final two players for each level will play against each other to become the first annual Defcon Guitar Hero champion!
   <br> * It is VERY important to pick the right songs to get into the finals.  Some songs have more notes, for more Star Power and higher points, as some songs have less notes.
  <br> * All songs in the finals will be chosen by the event coordinators and will not be announced until the start of the finals.  Final songs will not be songs included in Xbox Live downloadable content, so that no player has an advantage over others, GOOD LUCK!
<br><br>


Defcon STAR POWER!!!
<br>
Do you want an extra 1000 points added on to your song???  Do ya?  Bring me a COLD unopened beer!  I won't accept it if it's opened (no date rape drugs for the contest organizers!) <br><br>

Any beer, except for Guinness, you get an extra 1000 points of Star Power!  Keep in mind that 6-packs are appreciated, but it will still only get you 1000 points!  I love beer, but it's not fair to bring a case of beer and get an extra 12000 points!<br><br>

Wake up and smell the coffee war, people: DefCon 15 is just around the corner, and that means another edition of the world's best-known hacker coffee competition. Already, the frenzy has begun! <br />
<br />
Now's the time when you have an All-Inclusive Divine Excuse to unashamedly mingle with your own kind without having to shroud your activities under the shadow of the Evil Corporate Coffee Empire! Yes, now we caffeine fiends can gather without shame! 
<br />
<br />
WHAT? You want a shot of espresso?! We got your shot right here, pal. This event ain't no freebie. If you want a cup, you gotta pony up. Coffee, that is. Whole bean. We're judging it all. The best, the strongest, the most caffeinated. You name it. ...but regular store-bought or corporate coffee trash will only earn a trashing. 
<br />
<br />
You think you got what it takes? Then we'll take what you got! Bring your best beans and put 'em up for judgment by our over-qualified, over-caffeinated, (and over-rated) Coffee Wars judges and contestant panel! We keep hearing that someone else's beans are the best. Now it's time to prove it bean-to-bean!<br />

            <description><![CDATA[The idea is simple.. form a team, get a box, open box.<br />
<br />
But is it that simple? The box is a mystery, with many puzzles involved in opening it. To get things going for this year Lost Boy has started to accept team sign ups, as well as release clues to hint at some of the puzzles involved.<br />

<br />
Here is a picture on how NOT to open a mystery box:<br />

            <title>Capture the Flag Contest Announced!</title>
            <link>http://kenshoto.allyourboxarebelongto.us:1337/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[
                Capture the Flag at DEFCON continues it's long tradition with the announcement by Kenshoto of the CtF qualification round!<br />
<br />
>From their announcement:<br />
<br />
Kenshoto's army of code-gnomes has been working feverishly on the production of this years installment of WarGamez (CTF), more to come here yet tonight, but we'll be making the quals announcement *very* soon.
<br />
<br />
Check it:
<br />
<br />
Dr. Kenneth Shoto proudly announces that the qualifying round for the Defcon Capture the Flag contest is now pen for registration. The qualifying contest will start at 1 June 2007 @ 2200 EST and end 3 June 2007 @ 2200 EST.
<br />
<br />
Teams can be any size you'd like (more ninjas clearly == better) and each team will need to register before 1 June 2007 @ 2200 EST in order to get an account for the actual game. The top 7 teams qualify for a seat at the table at the proverbial 'big show' (the actual CtF competition) to be held at Defcon 15. Defcon takes place August 3-5th 2007 (https://www.defcon.org/) so make sure you clear all those WoW, D&D, and Eve-Online play dates off your calendar early.
<br />
<br />
That's right hackers and hackettes, get your debuggers warmed up and your shellcode tested, cuz it's that time of year again. What you say? You don't know what the hell we're talking about? Well, peep dis:
<br />
<br />
The core of the qualifying competition will be a quiz-like interface where each team may select a question and then must hack until they can answer it. Topics will vary widely, but of course include such fan-favorites as reversing martian binaries, landing shellcode and a double lutz
simultaneously, and stealing information from strange places. We've also thrown in challenges like intar-webs hax0rification and mind-bendy trivia so the 5kr1p+ K1dd1e5 can play along (much love).
<br />
<br />
This year the game allows for maximum parallelization on questions. When the leading team selects a question, that question (and all the ones they already answered) becomes available to the trailing teams. In other words, there is no need to register multiple ghost accounts
as they won't give any advantage (*ahem*skewl*cough)...
<br />
<br />
Don't have the stones to think you can win? Well, you should sign-up and play anyway. The winning team from last year actually got primed up for the game by competing in quals. They then kicked it up a notch by spending the next three months figuring out every detail of every challenge we put out there and explaining it all as if paid to do so (check it out http://nopsr.us/ctf2006prequal/). Besides, how else are you gonna sharpen those skillz and convert yourself from poser to p3wner?
<br />
<br />
So what are you waiting for? Jump onto your nops-sled and slide over to http://kenshoto.allyourboxarebelongto.us:1337/ to sign up for quals now...

            <title>Announcing Brew Wars!</title>

            <description><![CDATA[
                Announcing Brew Wars for DC 15!<br />
<br />
It's time to remind everyone of Brew Wars again. The very first Brew Wars will happen this year at Defcon 15.<br />
<br />
The rules are simple. Just bring twenty four ounces of your home brew to Defcon. A judging panel of three people, including myself, will drink and rate each brew. The beer will be rated on a scale of 1-10. Each beer will be judged in it's catergory. The standard of each category of beer is last year's winner of the Great American Beer Festival in the style you have entered. A list of those winning beers can be found at the URL below.
<br />
<br />
http://www.beertown.org/events/gabf/...medalists.aspx<br />
<br />
<br />
The judges will be blind tasting the beers. The only information given to the judges will be what style of beer it is.
<br />
<br />
Judges will not be allowed to enter their own brews.<br />
<br />
Judges have already been selected. All judges are were at the GABF and sampled all winning brews. Extensive tasting notes were taken at the time.
<br />
<br />
I have sourced a glass carboy for the winner. This carboy will be etched will a logo commemorating the event. If your beer is good enough, you could soon be brewing your next batch in a unique carboy.<br />
<br />
Dr. Faustus

            <title>DEFCON 15 CFP Now Open!!</title>
            <link>https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-15/dc-15-cfp-form.html</link>
            <description><![CDATA[
                DEFCON 15 Call For Papers is now officially Open and will close on June 15, 2007.
<br />
Don't know what DEFCON is? Go to https://www.defcon.org/ and clue up!
<br />
<br />
Papers and presentations are now being accepted for DEFCON 15, the conference your mother and ISC(2) warned you about. DEFCON will take place at the Riviera in Las Vegas, NV, USA, August 3-5, 2007.
<br />
<br />
Last year, we eliminated speaking tracks, and we received a diverse selection of submissions. From hacking your car, your brain, and CIA sculptures to hacking the vote, Bluetooth, and DNS hacks. We group presentations by subject and come up with topic areas of interest. It worked out so well in the past we are doing it again.
<br />
<br />
What are we looking for then, if we don't have tracks? Were looking for the presentation that you've never seen before and have always wanted to see. We are looking for the presentation that the attendees wouldn't ask for, but blows their minds when they see it. We want strange demos of Personal GPS jammers, RFID zappers, and HERF madness. Got a MITM attack against cell phones? We want to see it.
<br />
<br />
Subjects that we have traditionally covered in the past, and will continue to accept include: Trojan development, worms, malware, intelligent agents, protocol exploits, application security, web security, database hacking, privacy issues, criminal law, civil law, international law/treaties, prosecution perspectives, 802.11X, bluetooth, cellular telephony protocols, privacy, identity theft, identity creation, fraud, social implications of technology, media/film presentations, firmware hacking, hardware hacking, embedded systems hacking, smartcard technologies, credit card and financial instrument technologies, surveillance, counter-surveillance, UFO's, peer2peer technologies, reputation systems, copyright infringement and anti-copyright infringement enforcement technologies, critical infrastructure issues, physical security, social engineering, academic security research, PDA and cell phone security, EMP/HERF weaponry, TEMPEST technologies, corporate espionage, IDS evasion.
<br />
<br />
What a mouth full! Well you can't say we didn't give you some ideas. This list is not intended to limit possible topics, merely to give examples of topics that have interested us in the past, and is in fact the same list we used last year..
<br />
<br />
Check out https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-14/dc-14-speakers.html for past conference presentations to get a complete list of past topics that were accepted if you want to learn from the past.
<br />
<br />
We are looking for and give preference to: unique research, new tool releases, Ø day attacks (with responsible disclosure), highly technical material, social commentaries, and ground breaking material of any kind. Want to screen a new hacking documentary or release research? Consider DEFCON.
<br />
<br />
Speaking Formats:
<br />
Choose between 12 hundred seconds, 50 minutes, 110 minutes, or a break out format of a length you determine.
We are continuing the Twelve Hundred Second Spotlight, which is a shorter presentation (about twenty minutes) that doesn't warrant a full 50 or 110 minute talk. The Twelve Hundred Second Spotlight is designed for those who don't have enough material for a full talk, but still have a valuable contribution to make. This is to ensure that great ideas that can be presented quickly don't fall through the cracks merely because they didn't justify a full length talk. Examples include research, announcements, group presentations, projects needing volunteers or testers, requests for comments, updates on previously given talks, quick demonstrations. You get the idea. Presenters will get a speaker badge which entitles them to free admittance to DEFCON, but we will be unable to pay an Honorarium.
<br />
<br />
Remember being attacked by flying meat? Do you remember thick accented Germans trying to convince you to attack critical infrastructure? Do you remember extravagant vapor ware releases by a stage filled with posses? We do, and sans projectiles of raw meat we want to encourage such shenanigans again this year. We are calling on all "hacker groups" (you know who you are, and the FBI has a nifty file with your name on it) to present at DEFCON, to discuss what you're up to, what your mission is, to discuss any upcoming or past projects, and to discuss parties/conferences you are throwing. We do humbly request that all gang warfare be relegated to electronic attacks, and not fall over into meat space.
<br />
<br />
New for DEFCON 15:
<br />
The second year being at the Riviera has allowed us to make some changes to the format from last year. We have more speaking rooms, and because of this I want to announce a call for workshops, demos, and mini trainings. We have additional small rooms that will enable highly focused demonstrations or workshops. If you want to talk about building a passport cloner or a tutorial on developing Metasploit exploits this might be the format for you. You tell us how much time you need, and we try to accommodate you!
<br />
<br />
To submit a speech Complete the Call for Papers Form at: https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-15/dc-15-cfp-form.html and send to talks at defcon dot org. You will receive a confirmation within 48 hours of submission.
<br />
<br />
We are going to continue last year's goal of increasing the quality of the talks by screening people and topics. I realize you guys are speaking for basically free, but some talks are better than others. Some people put in a bit more effort than others. I want to reward the people who do the work by making sure there is room for them.
<br />
<br />
This year we will have two rounds of speaker acceptance. In the first round we will fill about half of the schedule before the submission deadline, and the remaining half afterwards. This is to encourage people to submit as early as possible and allows attendees to plan on the topics that interest them. If you see the schedule on-line start to fill, do not worry if you have not heard from us yet, as we are still in the process of selection.
<br />
<br />
Barring a disaster of monstrous proportions, speaker selection will be completed no later July 1. The sooner you submit the better chance you have of the reviewers to give your presentation the full consideration it warrants. If you wait until the last minute to submit, you have less of a chance of being selected.
<br />
<br />
After a completed CFP form is received, speakers will be contacted if there are any questions about their presentations. If your talk is accepted you can continue to modify and evolve it up until the last minute, but don't deviate from your accepted presentation. We will mail you with information on deadlines for when we need your presentation, to be burnt on the CDROM, as well as information for the printed program.
<br />
<br />
Speakers get in to the show free, get paid (AFTER they give a good presentation!), get a coolio badge, and people like you more. Heck, most people find it is a great way to meet people or find other people interested in their topics. Speakers can opt to forgo their payment and instead receive three human badges that they can give to their friends, sell to strangers, or hold onto as timeless mementoes. Receiving badges instead of checks has been a popular option for those insisting on maintaining their anonymity.

            <description><![CDATA["Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Why the Pentagon's toughest Internet crime fighter likes hanging out with blackhat hackers" is the sub title of the article.<br />
DEFCON<br />
It turns out to be a well written piece about Jim Christy's career and the birth of the DoD Cybercrime Center. It is set to a back drop of DEF CON 14, and has a couple funny bits, some interesting war stories plus a quote from me. <br />

<br />
A snip from the article:<br />
"Christy points out a pulsing vein in the guy's neck – suggesting it's a sign he is lying. The guy calls Christy an old man. He hints that maybe he might have some small connection to Mossad. As he finally sits down, Christy passes him a business card."]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[DEFCON has released the second batch of content from DC-14 encoded for download. This marks the third step of moving away from the real media server to a direct download model in an effort to spread far and wide the presentations from past DEFCON conventions.<br /><br />
The new media server will be going on-line in the next month, and because the old media server is out of drive space you will notice that all DC 7 content has been taken off line to make room.<br />
<br />
Once the new media server is on-line all past content will be restored!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Happy Holidays from all of us here at Defcon!<br />

We would like to wish you the best this Holiday season. We hope you have plenty of family, food and fun to go around. If you get bored you can always gather the family around the warm glow of your flat screen to watch the ghosts of presentations past.  There is no better gift than that.  Unless of course your loved ones headed over to Jinx and got you some sweet Defcon gear!<br />

<br />
We also wanted to remind you that pics.defcon.org is up and running, we are looking forward to seeing it grow with the new year.  If you get together with your fellow hackers this holiday season, or mod that must have Christmas gift, feel free to upload your photos in the members and dc groups galleries.
<br />
<br />
That said, Eat plenty of other peoples food, stay up late with your new shiny toys and have fun with friends and family. See you next year!]]></description>

DEFCONDEFCON<br />
What is it you ask? Think of it as a repository for all pictures related to DEF CON. It is a place you can upload your pictures and arrange them however you want. Others can comment on them, vote, or put them in their own favorites album.<br />
<br />
The idea is that as people change providers there is no long term repository for DEF CON pictures except to the links www.defconpics.org points to. Because they don't mirror the content I wanted to create a free place for people to share their pictures that won't change or go down.<br />
<br />
The pics software is integrated with the defcon forums, so if you already have an account there you automatically have an account on pics.defcon.org.<br />

<br />
So get busy! Upload those pictures. both http and https connections work. Spread the word!<br />]]></description>

            <title>DEFCON 14 Speakers Selected!</title>
            <link>http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-14/dc-14-schedule.html</link>
            <description><![CDATA[
                Hey everyone, I want to make some announcements surrounding DEFCON 14.<br>
DEFCONDEFCONDEFCONDEFCON<br>
It's about that time to briefly lay down the inf0z, so here it goes.<br>
<br>
- Speakers have been selected, and are now listed on-line:<br>
http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-14/dc-14-schedule.html<br>
<br>
They include an assistant Secretary of Defense, an FBI agent, Scary Hackers, privacy fanatics, security studs, and a hardware hacking ninja.<br>
<br>
- The con hotel is sold out, but overflow exists here:<br>
http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-14/dc-14-hotel.html<br>
<br>
- Need a ride or got a room to spare? Check out the ride and room section of the DEF CON Forums<br>
https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=26<br>
<br>
- There are a lot of new contests, and some old ones that are no more (We'll miss you WiFi Shootout!) I'd mention them all, but it takes up too much space. To get a good grip on what is happening I'd suggest reading the contest area of the forums:<br>
https://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=102<br>
<br>
- Black and White Ball is two nights this year, with some great bands and DJs including Regenerator, The Minibosses, DJ Jackalope, Catharsis and DJ Wintamute.<br>
<br>
- DEF CON 13 Audio and Video is now on-line for DOWNLOAD. Yep, you saw that right. We are phasing out the real media server and going to download mode. The audio is in .mp3, and the video is in H.264 2-pass 192k .mp4, optimized for the iPod video screen size. Right now you gotta subscribe to the rss feed, but the web site will soon sport the direct links. We hope to have DC-12 on-line in the next week.<br>
http://www.defcon.org/defconrss.xml<br>
<br>
Notes:<br>
This year we are at a  new hotel, the Riviera. I did this because DEF CON was going to stagnate and die if it stayed at the Alexis Park any longer. The benefits of the new hotel are that the speaking rooms are larger, there is air conditioning, and we have room to grow. This year we get about 1/2 the space, and next year we should get 3/4 of the space. That extra room will allow us to offer break out classes, get togethers, and an additional track of speaking. Things we could only dream of before, but now are possible. It will take us all a year or two to learn what to do with all the space, but those are the kinds of problems I can live with. Did I mention the sky boxes?<br>
<br>
General hang out site: http://forum.defcon.org/<br>
<br>
Remember DEF CON is what you make of it, and we have been lucky over the years to have a great group of people supporting us. The line up this year looks great, and the rest is up to us.

            <title>Crypto utopia Sealand ravaged by fire by Andrew Orlowski</title>
            <link>http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/06/26/sealand_blaze/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Andrew over at The Register writes about a fire that broke out on Sea Land wrecking the generator room. For those not familiar, there was a talk by Ryan Lacky of HavenCo, a company set up on Sea Land to provide privacy services. I believe it inspired some of the characters in Neil Stephenson's Cryptonomicon book (Go read it.. very good)<br />
<br />

I've wondered what happened since the business imploded in 2003, but from the article it seems not much.<br />
<br />
Fire has damaged a World War II gun emplacement seven miles off the English coast. Better known as "Sealand", the fort was acquired in the 1960s by Roy Bates, who declared it an independent principality."<br />
<br />
"In a presentation to the 2003 DefCon convention, a former employee described how internal politics and a lack of investment backing had thwarted the experiment. Contracts were broken, the bandwidth never materialised, and the location was vulnerable to DOS attacks. At the time [6] of his 2003 presentation, HavenCo had no new customers, and had seen several of its existing customers leave."]]></description>

            <title>Todd Moore, Treasure hunter contestant, spoke at DEFCON 12 on "Cracking Net2Phone"</title>
            <link>http://www.nbc.com/Treasure_Hunters/teams/excia_todd.shtml</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Since Todd has been announced as a participant on NBC's new show "Treasure Hunters" we have had more than enough curious folks interested in his presentation. We will be watching him on the new show when it airs, in the meantime you can watch him now on his Defcon 12:"Cracking Net2Phone" Presentation.<br />

<br />
Do you think using Internet Telephony is more secure than a regular phone? Think again!  Internet Telephony is becoming more common and those that think it is safer from wiretaps than regular phone communications are wrong. This presentation will demonstrate how to decrypt Net2Phone's dialed phone numbers, and playback fully reconstructed audio conversations from network packet captures.  Included will be a demonstration of NetWitness 5.0's VOIP playback capability.<br />
<br />
Todd Moore is the product manager of NetWitness, a commercially available cyber-forensics tool. Moore's extensive knowledge of Internet technologies, network security, and software development helped make NetWitness well-known for providing powerful insight into network traffic.<br />
<br />
Moore has over ten years of professional experience in the field of network security and has extensive experience developing commercial software applications. He has a bachelor in Computer Science from Old Dominion University and is a Microsoft Certified Solution Developer (MCSD).  Moore started with CTX Corporation in 1996 securing global intranets and designing network security software to help audit and analyze network traffic. He joined Forensics Explorers, a Division of ManTech ISandT, as Director of Software Development in 1999 and later became the NetWitness Product Manager.<br />

<br />
Moore teaches classes on designing quality software and has made numerous television appearances presenting the latest in technology trends. He has two patent pending inventions in the field of cyber-forensics. Moore resides in the greater Washington, D.C. area.]]></description>

            <title>Cybersecurity contests go national by Robert Lemos</title>
            <link>http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11394/1</link>
            <description><![CDATA[I saw this over on SecurityFocus written by Rob Lemos, a long time Info Sec reporter with a solid reputation.<br />

<br />
It is a piece about how "Cybersecurity" events are going national. From Old old CTF games, to DEFCON, to the Cyber Defense Exercise (CDX) to the new CCDC it is all a progression of learning through different game challenges.<br />
<br />
It makes a couple brief mentions of DEFCON, but does not explain who or what we are. That's OK. If people really want to know, they'll find us.. From the article:<br />
<br />

"As the hackers came in, you could see (the students') reactions: They were frustrated when they saw the attackers breach their systems and excited when they stopped the attack," said John Carr, a mentor for the team fielded by Valley High School of West Des Moines and senior solutions consultant with Iowa-based technology consulting firm QCI."]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[From By Robert McMillan at Computerworld some words about database security researcher and Oracle. DEFCON devotees may well recognize David's and Caesar's contributions to this space.<br />
<br />
Oracle once marketed its database as unbreakable, but security researcher David Litchfield has a less inflated opinion of the software.<br />

<br />
"God forbid that any of our critical national infrastructure runs on this product," he said recently on the widely read Bugtraq security mailing list. Oops it does.]]></description>

            <title>Ride and Room sharing forum now open</title>
            <link>http://forum.defcon.org/forumdisplay.php?f=26</link>
            <description><![CDATA[
                Going to DEFCON 13? Want to share a ride or a room? Got extra space in your car or room?<br>
<br>
Now is your chance to find others and make new friends. From TheCotMan's post about this:<br>
<br>
Suggestions:<br>
Your best bet in finding a ride, or room sharing is actually found by attending your local Defcon User Group, getting to know people in person, who then may give you space in their room. Trying to hook up with people on the Defcon Forums is a tricky thing.<br>
<br>
Generally, strangers won't offer other strangers space in their room. People will want some sort of references-- someone both parties know and trust to vouch for you.<br>
<br>
The Unofficial Defcon Faq http://defcon.stotan.org/faq/ was written by many, and assembled by HighWizard. It has some outdated information for when the convention was at the Alexis Park but also has some useful information about room sharing, and life at Defcon.<br>
<br>
Good luck.

            <description><![CDATA[DEFCON has released the first batch of content from DC-13 encoded for download. This marks the first step of moving away from the real media server to a direct download model in an effort to spread far and wide the presentations from past DEFCON conventions.<br />
<br />
The first release is .mp4 video files in an iPod friendly h.264 format. Soon to follow will be the .mp3 versions of all the same presentations. As time goes on we will be re-encoding all previous conference content and releasing it!]]></description>

            <link>http://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-14/dc-14-speakers.html</link>
            <description><![CDATA[The speaker selection process for DEFCON 14 is now underway, with early selections being made. While the CfP closes officially in two weeks, we are doing early selection to fill half the speaking spots now to speed things up. We will try very hard to have the process completed in two weeks, right at the end of the deadline. We'll be making announcements on-line as well as on forums and mailing lists.<br />
<br />
If you submitted a talk, look for acceptance or rejections over the next two weeks in your email. I am proud to say some of the submissions this year are of very high quality, and we should break in the Rivera with some killer content.<br />
<br />
As usual we are talking about the con over on the forum.defcon.org system.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Well it has taken a bit of work to get the old web server happy with serving http 1.1 compressed content, but now that it is you should see a speed improvement in page views as well as availability.<br />
These changes are in preparation for the site and server change over, something that I hope will happen in the next week.<br />
If your browser supports content-encoding compressed, you should see a gain! Also note that forums.defcon.org is also enabling compression later this week after some testing. This is a good thing leading up to the convention because it is effectively like buying more bandwidth with a software upgrade.]]></description>

            <title>Capture the Flag pre-qualification opens!</title>
            <link>http://kenshoto.com/quals/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[
                From Kenshoto's announcement: Once again ... <br>
kenshoto will be running the Defcon Capture the Flag contest in 2006. This year's CtF will be a knock-down-drag-out-cyberninja war, the likes of which the world has never seen (except maybe last year). <br>
<br>
For the qualifying round, we've widened the scope from last year. With multiple challenges in various categories, there's something for every hacker, regardless of skillset (except running scripts and writing perl). <br>
<br>
The core skill for this contest will be finding vulnerabilities in software. Those of you who have avoided playing in CtF because you think it is for lamers, we bet you can't find all our vulnerabilities. <br>
<br>
Teams will still need to defend a server, and will need to be able to exploit the vulnerabilities they find. As last year, the vulnerabilities will be 100%-custom, so leave your nessus, metasploit and core impact bullshit at home. <br>
<br>
There will be a qualifying round, which will start on Friday, June 9th at 10:00 PM EDT. Only 8 teams will qualify. Last year's winners,Shellphish, are automatically qualified (leaving 7 team slots), unless they too decide to play in the qualifying round, in which case they will still need to place in the top 8.<br>
Registration is currently open at http://kenshoto.com/quals/ <br>
<br>
We encourage anyone (even individuals) to attempt to qualify, even if as a learning experience. We intend quals to be enjoyable for everyone,regardless of your plans for Defcon. <br>
Challenges will range wildlyin difficulty from Mitnick to Eagle we've got it all. Good luck... you're going to need it. <br>
<br>

            <description><![CDATA[&lt;P>Charlie Demerjian over at the Inquirer has a piece about HP shooting a .308 bullet at an XP12000 storage array, and the array still functioning. I have questions about where the bullet actually went, I mean if it smashed all the controller cards or went through the power supplies it wouldn't still function. But hey! They got it just right. The best part, though, is the end.&lt;/P>

&lt;P>'The XP12000 was then brought back to a fully functional state without any loss of uptime. Not bad at all. As far as I know, this is the only test of it's type, but I am sure we could arrange something similar at DefCon if Sun wants to loan us a 15K.'&lt;/P>]]></description>
